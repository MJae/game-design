This is where we share all of our ideas and concepts for this project.

## How to use
There is no need to fork this repo, or submit pull requests, since we're not using this for executable code. Simply respect the content, and the folder structures that have been added by others. If you wish to make a significant change, such as reorganizing files, then a pull request would be appropriate.

6. Now add a test file. `echo "hello, Git" > test.txt`
7. Check that it's there. `ls`
8. Stage it. `git add test.txt`
9. See that it's staged. `git status` (should see "new file: test.txt" in green)
10. Commit change. `git commit -m "Add test file"`
